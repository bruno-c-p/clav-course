     * A company that has several functional features that are the names, amount of

     * salary and show name, old and new salary. The readjustment criteria are as
     * follows:
     * 
     * and Employees with a salary lower than 1,900.00 will have a 40% readjustment;
     * 
     * and Employees with a salary between 1,000 (inclusive) and 3,000.00
     * (inclusive) must have a 30% readjustment;
     * 
     * and Employees with a salary greater than 3,000.00 must have a 20%
     * readjustment.
     * 
     * and Dependent shutdown will be plus 1% readjustment.
     * 
     * Create a method to read the data, another to calculate the readjustment and
     * another to show the dialogs.
     * 
     * Feel free to define the input and return parameters of the function, but
     * always aiming at the least possible use of variables.
